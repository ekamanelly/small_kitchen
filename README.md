I have made:

- a [_helpers_](lib/helpers) folder where I have put all the utilities of the project such as constant values, dart enumerate, extensions, theming, and other general utilities.
- a [_models_](lib/models) folder where I have put all the data's classes representation.
- a [_services_](lib/services) folder where I have put all folders relative to data's storing and fetching base on local storage, firebase, or API.
- a [_viewmodels_](lib/viewmodels) folder where I put all the viewmodels related files. In the easiest way, I call viewmodel a bridge between the models, services, and views. Their job is to handle the business logic of the view they are related to in order to make the views part safe from anything non-relevant to UI.
- a [_views_](lib/views) folder where are stored the UI part of the application. Each view/page/screen of the application is put here in differents folders. Those folders contain the base file of the view and a widgets folder where are stored the widgets which are used **only** on this view. The **global** widgets are located in the [widgets](lib/views/widgets) folder.

I have also added a base class for viewmodels [here](lib/viewmodels/base_viewmodel.dart). All the next viewmodels you'll write should inherit from the BaseViewModel class. There is also a BaseView widget [here](lib/views/base_view.dart) to mix the access easily to the base viewmodel proper to each class.

At the root of the app, you will see the [locator.dart](lib/locator.dart) file where I registered an instance of each service and viewmodel in order to use them efficiently in the whole app. You will also find the [routes.dart](lib/routes.dart) where the named routes of the app are stored in the AppRouter class.
